## Introduction

Gemstone Price Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the prices of gemstones based on several features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and more. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate the market value of gemstones, which can be useful for jewelers, gem traders, and collectors.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to understand relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Modeling**: Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models to identify the best-performing one.
- **Prediction**: Making predictions on new gemstone data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [mention the source if applicable]. It contains multiple features that describe the characteristics of gemstones, including:

- **Carat**: Weight of the gemstone.
- **Cut**: Quality of the cut.
- **Color**: Color grade of the gemstone.
- **Clarity**: Clarity grade of the gemstone.
- **Depth**: Total depth percentage.
- **Table**: Width of the top of the gemstone.
- **Price**: Price of the gemstone (target variable).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
