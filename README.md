## Introduction

Gemstone Price Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the prices of gemstones based on several features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and more. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate the market value of gemstones, which can be useful for jewelers, gem traders, and collectors.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to understand relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Modeling**: Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models to identify the best-performing one.
- **Prediction**: Making predictions on new gemstone data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [mention the source if applicable]. It contains multiple features that describe the characteristics of gemstones, including:

- **Carat**: Weight of the gemstone.
- **Cut**: Quality of the cut.
- **Color**: Color grade of the gemstone.
- **Clarity**: Clarity grade of the gemstone.
- **Depth**: Total depth percentage.
- **Table**: Width of the top of the gemstone.
- **Price**: Price of the gemstone (target variable).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krishna2win/GemstonePricePrediction.git
   cd GemstonePricePrediction

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

After installation, you can run the Jupyter notebooks provided to explore the data, train models, and make predictions. The main notebook for the project is `Gemstone_Price_Prediction.ipynb`.

To start the Jupyter notebook server, run:
   ``bash
   jupyter notebook
Open the Gemstone_Price_Prediction.ipynb notebook and follow the instructions to run the cells.


## Modeling

The project explores various machine learning models, including:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

The best model is selected based on performance metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results

The final model achieved a good performance with an R-squared value of `X.XX`, MAE of `Y.YY`, and RMSE of `Z.ZZ`. These metrics indicate that the model can predict gemstone prices with reasonable accuracy.
